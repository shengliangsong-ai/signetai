# Contributing to Signet AI Labs

Thank you for your interest in the Signet Protocol. We are building the infrastructure for the next billion AI users.

## How to Contribute
1.  **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the repo.
2.  **Create a Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/signet-enabled-tool-name`.
3.  **Implement the SDK**: Ensure your tool implements the `SignetPayload` interface defined in `types.ts`.
4.  **Test for Parity**: Use the Neural Lens emulator to verify your tool's symbolic parity score.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Provide a detailed description of how your tool enhances the ecosystem.

## Signet-Enabled Tool Requirements
To be merged into the official ecosystem, your tool:
- MUST implement the Signet SDK.
- MUST provide a mechanism for Human Master Signets.
- SHOULD support the 100x Signet Pool logic for cost efficiency.

## Code of Conduct
We follow a strict "Accountability First" policy. Hallucinations in documentation or adversarial contributions will be flagged by the Digital Checker.
