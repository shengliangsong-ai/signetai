## Entry 11: C2PA Compatibility Matrix & Auditor Resources
**Date:** February 14, 2026  
**Task Goal:** Published C2PA Compatibility Matrix and official specification reference links.

**Reasoning Path:**  
To establish industry legitimacy, we must explicitly map our proprietary VPR (Verifiable Proof of Reasoning) values against the established C2PA trust dimensions. Providing direct links to the C2PA specification ensures that technical auditors can verify our manifest structure against global standards.

**Verification Check:**  
- Alignment Matrix: 4-tier trust comparison verified.
- External Links: C2PA and CAI landing pages linked.
- UI: Auditor Callout Box integrated into #standards view.
