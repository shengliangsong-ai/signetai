## Entry 09: C2PA-Signet Hybrid Standard
**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Task Goal:** Integrated C2PA-Signet Hybrid Standard and published VPR JSON Schema (`org.signetai.vpr`).

**Reasoning Path:**  
By aligning with C2PA, we bridge the gap between "Content Provenance" (industry standard) and "Cognitive Provenance" (our proprietary protocol). This ensures Signet-verified assets are interoperable with existing verification tools while providing a deeper layer of deterministic auditability.

**Verification Check:**  
Symbolic Parity Check (Internal Neural Lens):
- Compliance: ISO/C2PA 2.2.0 compatibility confirmed.
- Schema: `org.signetai.vpr` draft v0.2.2 finalized.
- UI: Comparison matrix deployed to #standards.
