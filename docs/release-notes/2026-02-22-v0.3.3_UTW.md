# Signet AI Release Notes

## Version
- `v0.3.3_UTW`
- Date: `2026-02-22`

## Highlights

### 1. Difference Engine (YouTube Quick Mode Stabilization)
- Standardized Source A/B comparison around YouTube playlist/video inputs.
- Enforced 4-anchor thumbnail comparison for browser-safe operation.
- Improved debug trace and scoring transparency.
- Added better performance summary visibility.

### 2. Universal Media Lab (Any Size. Zero RAM.)
- Strengthened MP4 signing and verification pipeline with UTW metadata.
- Added automatic verification output after sign/load.
- Added frame sampling metadata (`1_FRAME_PER_MINUTE`, `offset=+7s`) with frame previews and perceptual hashes.
- Added YouTube OAuth resumable upload support.
- Added automatic human-readable + machine-readable metadata generation for YouTube description/comment workflows.

### 3. Batch Processor Upgrades
- Added MP4-focused result columns:
  - MP4 Audit summary
  - Frames checked
  - pHash64 preview
  - Final hash
  - Audit detail
- Preserved one-row-per-file reporting structure.
- Added per-row `Open Report` action for MP4 files.
- Added Batch → Universal handoff to render the same `Universal Integrity Verified` report page with frame sample table.

### 4. Hashing/Verification Consistency Fixes
- Fixed hash-mode mismatch between signer and batch verifier by honoring `hashing_mode` (`SHA256_BLOCK_CHAINED` / `SHA256_FULL`).
- Improved UTW embedded-manifest extraction via adaptive tail scan.
- Improved status handling for presence-only embedded manifests.

### 5. Identity Authority Enhancements
- Updated registration methods in UI to:
  - Google
  - GitHub
  - Phone (SMS)
- Removed Facebook login from active registration flow.
- Added phone auth debug trace and stronger error diagnostics.
- Added account-linking flow for `auth/account-exists-with-different-credential` between Google/GitHub.
- Improved ownership/race handling around registry writes and auth token refresh.

### 6. Legal and Policy Pages
- Added Terms of Service page: `/#terms`
- Added User Data Deletion page: `/#data-deletion`
- Linked legal endpoints from Privacy page and site navigation.

## Security Rules
- Updated `firestore.rules` ownership checks around `ownerUid == request.auth.uid` for identity writes.
- Simplified provider dependency in rules to reduce provider-claim edge-case failures.

## Operational Notes
- YouTube quick compare mode remains thumbnail-anchor based in browser context.
- Phone auth may hit Firebase anti-abuse throttling (`auth/too-many-requests`) in rapid retry scenarios; use Firebase test numbers for development.

## Compatibility
- Existing UTW assets remain supported.
- Batch and Universal reports are now interoperable through local handoff payloads.
