# Long-Term Sustainability & Trust Model

### 1. Data Efficiency
* **Recursive Chain Compression:** Uses "Virtual Nodes" to "bake" long provenance histories into a single Compressed Provenance Document (CPD) to prevent file bloat.
* **Zero-Copy Streaming:** Efficiently processes large media assets in 5MB chunks to ensure performance on standard hardware.

### 2. The Trust Economy
* **Trust Score Attrition:** Mitigates "Clean Slate" attacks by penalizing identities that repeatedly strip provenance metadata.
* **Difference Engine:** Calculates the perceptual distance between reference sources and candidate assets to verify integrity over time.

### 3. Open Governance
The core protocol is maintained under an Apache 2.0 license, ensuring the infrastructure remains a transparent public utility.
