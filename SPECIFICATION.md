# Signet Protocol Specification (v0.2)
**Draft-Song-Signet-Neural-Lens-02**

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the Signet Protocol, a standard for attaching cryptographic proof of reasoning (VPR) to AI-generated content.

## 2. Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## 3. The X-Signet-VPR Header
All Signet-compliant API responses MUST include the `X-Signet-VPR` header. This header contains a base64-encoded JSON object representing the signature chain.

### 3.1 Payload Structure
```json
{
  "protocol_version": "0.2",
  "timestamp": 1740000000,
  "chain": [
    {
      "entity": "MODEL",
      "id": "gemini-3-pro-preview",
      "signature": "..."
    },
    {
      "entity": "TOOL",
      "id": "neural-code-v2",
      "signature": "..."
    },
    {
      "entity": "HUMAN",
      "id": "master-curator-01",
      "signature": "..."
    }
  ],
  "parity_score": 0.998
}
```

## 4. Cryptographic Requirements
- **Algorithm**: MUST use Ed25519 for all signatures.
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 MUST be used for generating input/output content hashes.
- **Key Storage**: Keys generated by the TrustKeyService SHOULD be stored in Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or TEEs.

## 5. Neural Lens Verification
The Neural Lens MUST perform a multi-modal check where text output is compared against a visual or data-driven "substrate" to ensure symbolic parity.

- A parity score < 0.8 SHOULD trigger an automatic audit.
- A parity score < 0.5 MUST invalidate the signature chain.
